What does that "No Combat" in the upper right corner mean?

If you are able to see that, it means anti combat logging is enabled.
Anti combat logging prevents players from simply logging out when
they have been shot to avoid death.
The next time they login, they will die anyway. When you have been
shot, the indicator will turn red, saying "Combat". It takes 30
seconds before the indicator goes back to green and says
"No Combat", at which point you can log off normally.
